BeatBot
=======

A robotic drumset that helps you make music.

##You choose the tempo.


For musicians, impromptu jam sessions can be sometimes a hassle, as you often need other musicians to build on your ideas. A melody maker needs percussionists, a percussionist needs melody makers, and conductors need symphonies. In order to fill this void, our hack **BeatBot** uses **Myo** technology and a robust beat detection algorithm to provide you with virtual musicians with inherent musicalityâ€”your musicality. *You set the tempo, you set the style,* and **BeatBot** will be your impromptu jam buddy.

**BeatBot** was inspired in part by countless hours of trying to practice jamming with others alone--from riffing the 12-bar blues on our own without a percussionist to lead the way, to air conducting imaginary symphonies. Using the **Myo** on your forearm, it currently follows your tempo, and will eventually follow other metrics like your key, volume and style, in order to provide a drum line or play a virtual ensemble to your musical choices. At this hackathon, we used the **BeatBot** to follow your strumming pattern on guitar and display an Arduino controlled LED display to show our output drum line. From the classically trained conductor to the 13-year-old punk fan, we hope **BeatBot** can always be your musical companion.
